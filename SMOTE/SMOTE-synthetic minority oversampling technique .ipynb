    "SMOTE is used when we have unbalanced dataset<br>\n",
    "What do you mean by unbalanced dataset?<br>\n",
    "Ans- Unbalanced dataset are those dataset in which amount of data of one class is more than other class for example you have a dataset containing 2 classes(binary classification) the amount of data for class 1 is 98% of complete data and 2% for class 0 so when you are trying to find the probabilty for both the classes the probability for class1 is nearly equal to 1 which will overcome class 0 its only because of the unbalanced data to.<br>\n",

    "### What SMOTE Actually is?\n",
    "it is a technique which is used to create synthetic data(fake data) for minority class(the class which is very less in comparision with other classes because the data of the minority class is very less in comparision to majority classes , therefore the algorihtm tends to become biased towards majority class.To perform unbiased or accurate classification we need the data which is not balanced that means they is not very large difference in the amount for different classes.\n",
    "so to remove unbiasness we need to balance our data and to do that we will generate fake data from the already present data for minority class which helps in increaing the amount of data for minority class and because of this we get good classfication."

    "1. Choose an example(a row vector) r randomly from minority class data\n",
